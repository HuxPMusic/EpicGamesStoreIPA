# Epic Games Store IPA Repository

We have partnered with [Signulous](https://www.signulous.com/)! They are providing us with support in our efforts to share games from Epic on iOS globally. New versions of apps are available immediately on Signulous. We'll publish IPA files a few days later, but using Signulous is the easiest way to install games like [Fortnite](https://www.signulous.com/fortnite) and support our team.

# Fortnite

## Installation Issues
Fortnite may crash on installation unless you're using TrollStore or a paid developer certificate. This is due to an Apple limitation that cannot be bypassed.

**[Download Fortnite for iOS 16.0+](https://github.com/atellies/EpicGamesStoreIPA/releases/download/latest/Fortnite.v31.00.2+UPD.ipa)**

## How to Install with an Apple Developer Certificate
If you have a MapleSign, Signulous certificate, or TrollStore, you should be able to install the IPA directly.

For users with their own paid certificate:
1. Enable the following entitlements:
   - **Extended Virtual Addressing**
   - **Increased Memory Limit**
2. Sign the IPA with your certificate using your preferred signing method.
