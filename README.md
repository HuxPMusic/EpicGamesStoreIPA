# Fortnite

## Crashing on Install
Unfortunately Fortnite will only work if you're using Trollstore or a paid dev cert, we recommend [MapleSign](https://maplesign.ca/),  this is due to an Apple limitation which cannot be fixed.

## How to install with Apple Dev cetificate 
If you own a MapleSign, Signulous cetificate or TrollStore you should be able to install without needing to do anything but downloading the IPA.

If you're using your own paid certificate enable the follow entitlements:
**Extended Virtual Addressing** and **Increased Memory Limit**.

Once you've done that go ahead and use your certification with the signing method of your choice.

## Support and other Issues
Please join this discord server: https://discord.gg/SzR5ykEe8D if you need support and would like to have the IPAs before anyone else as we decrypted both Fall Guys and Fortnite first.

## How to Install
Unlike Fortnite, Fall Guys does not need any kind of special entitlements to play.
I recommend using [ESign](https://esign.yyyue.xyz/) with any form of certificate or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) if you do not have a certificate.

~~If you are signing with ESign please enable **UISupportedDevices** and with Sideloadly enable **Remove Device Limiitation** in advanced options this should stop an "Unable to install" error appearing when you sign it.~~

Fall Guys has been updated to remove the step above and now works with every signer like Scarlet without crashing. Install the latest QoL IPA [Fall+Guys_FixedQoL_11.1.4_decrypted.ipa](https://github.com/atellies/EpicGamesStoreIPA/releases/download/meow/Fall+Guys_FixedQoL_11.1.4_decrypted.ipa)

If nothing else works run the fall guys IPA with [LiveContainer](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/LiveContainer)

If you're encountering any sort of crashes double check the IPA you downloaded, join the discord if you need further help.
