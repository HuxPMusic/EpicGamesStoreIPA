# Fortnite

## Installation Issues
Fortnite may crash on installation unless you're using TrollStore or a paid developer certificate. We recommend [MapleSign](https://maplesign.ca/) due to an Apple limitation that cannot be bypassed.

**[Download Fortnite for iOS 16.0+](https://github.com/atellies/EpicGamesStoreIPA/releases/download/latest/Fortnite.ipa)**

## How to Install with an Apple Developer Certificate
If you have a MapleSign, Signulous certificate, or TrollStore, you should be able to install the IPA directly.

For users with their own paid certificate:
1. Enable the following entitlements:
   - **Extended Virtual Addressing**
   - **Increased Memory Limit**
2. Sign the IPA with your certificate using your preferred signing method.

# Fall Guys

## Which Version Should I Install?

- **iOS 17.4+:** [Download Fall Guys for iOS 17.4+](https://github.com/atellies/EpicGamesStoreIPA/releases/download/latest/FallGuys.ipa)
- **iOS 16.0-17.3.1:** [Download Fall Guys for iOS 16.0-17.3.1](https://github.com/atellies/EpicGamesStoreIPA/releases/download/latest/FallGuys16.ipa)

## How to Install
Unlike Fortnite, Fall Guys doesn't require special entitlements to play. You can use [ESign](https://esign.yyyue.xyz/) with any certificate or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) without a certificate. The latest update works with any signing method, such as Scarlet, without crashing.
