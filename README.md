# Epic Games Store IPA Repository

# Fortnite

## Crashing on Install
Unfortunately Fortnite will only work if you're using Trollstore or a paid dev cert, we recommend [MapleSign](https://maplesign.ca/),  this is due to an Apple limitation which cannot be fixed.

## How to install with Apple Dev cetificate 
If you own a MapleSign or Signulous cetificate or TrollStore you should be able to install without needing to do anything but downloading the IPA.

If youre using your own paid certificate enable th follow entitlements:
**Extended Virtual Addressing** and **Increased Memory Limit**.

Once you've done that go ahead and use your certification with the signing method of your choice.

## Support and other Issues

# Fall Guys

iOS 17.6+: [Fall+Guys_11.1.4_decrypted.ipa](https://github.com/atellies/EpicGamesStoreIPA/releases/download/meow/Fall+Guys_11.1.4_decrypted.ipa)

## How to Install
Unlike Fortnite Fall Guys does not need any kind of special entitlements to play.
I recommend using [ESign](https://esign.yyyue.xyz/) with any form of certificate or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) if you do not have a certificate.

If you are signing with ESign please enable **UISupportedDevices** and with Sideloadly enable **Remove Device Limiitation** in advanced options this should stop an "Unable to install" error appearing when you sign it.

I'm unsure if other signing methods work since I only tested these two, go ahead and try your preferred way if you want.

If nothing else works run the fall gusy IPA with [LiveContainer](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/LiveContainer)
If you're encountering any sort of crashes double check the IPA you downloaded, join the discord if you need further help.
